---

## 🎯 **What You Need to Do**

### **Step 1: Apple Developer Setup (30 minutes)**

1. **Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)**
2. **Create Media ID:**
   - Description: "Adam & Courtney Wedding App Music"
   - Media ID: `com.adamcourtney.wedding2024.music`
3. **Generate API Key:**
   - Name: "Wedding App MusicKit Key"
   - Enable MusicKit checkbox
   - **Download the .p8 file immediately!**

### **Step 2: Collect Information**

After setup, you'll have:
```
Team ID: ABCD123456 (found in top-right of developer portal)
Key ID: XYZ9876543 (from the key you created)
Media ID: com.adamcourtney.wedding2024.music
Private Key: AuthKey_XYZ9876543.p8 file
```

### **Step 3: Configure Your App**

1. **Add to `.env.local`:**
```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPLE_MUSIC_TEAM_ID=ABCD123456
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPLE_MUSIC_KEY_ID=XYZ9876543
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPLE_MUSIC_MEDIA_ID=com.adamcourtney.wedding2024.music
```

2. **Place private key file in:**
```
WeddingExpoDemo/secrets/AuthKey_XYZ9876543.p8
```

3. **Create your wedding playlist in Apple Music:**
   - Name: "Adam & Courtney's Wedding 💒"
   - Make it public
   - Copy the playlist URL

### **Step 4: Final Integration (I'll do this)**

Once you provide the credentials, I'll:
1. **Replace JWT placeholder** with real token generation
2. **Add your playlist ID** to the app configuration
3. **Enable real-time playlist updates**
4. **Test the complete integration**
