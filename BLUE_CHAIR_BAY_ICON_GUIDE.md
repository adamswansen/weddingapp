### Step 3: Quick Photo Editing Tips

## üéØ Pro Tips

1. **Test the icon** - Make sure it looks good when very small (like 60√ó60px)
2. **Keep faces visible** - Don't crop too tight, but make sure you're the focus
3. **High contrast** - Beach photos can look washed out when small
4. **Save originals** - Keep backup copies of your edited images
